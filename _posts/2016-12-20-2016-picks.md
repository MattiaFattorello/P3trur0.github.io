This has been an interesting year in terms of personal experiences about Software Engineering.
This post is the list of my picks for 2016, grouped by category, of the most notable stuff I ran through during these 366 days.

## Best tools

#### - `git`

I have increased my knowledge about this essential tool thanks to [this course](http://www.optionfactory.net/courses/details/Git/)
and these two talks:  

- [Becoming a Git Master, by Nicola Paoloucci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kVzV6m5_Qg)
- [Wrapping Your Head Around Git, by Paolo 'Nusco' Perrotta](http://confreaks.tv/videos/gardencityrb2015-keynote-wrapping-your-head-around-git)

Also, since I spent my spare time working on various open source projects, I had the opportunity
to improve my git skills also by doing.
One of the main goals of my 2017 will be to keep on increasing my git abilities: I hope to turn from _git Padawan_ to _git Knight_.

#### - `sbt` and `IntelliJ`

My hardest struggle with tools in 2016 was while I was trying to implement a simple `sbt plugin` using `IntelliJ` as Scala IDE: I had no experience neither in sbt plugins development nor in IntelliJ indeed, so I spent a lot of time to setup a proper configuration for getting started.
Eventually, after evenings spent on tuning my environment, I was able to develop and test my first vanilla `sbt plugin` using an IDE I had never worked with.

#### - `Heroku`
I've deployed a set of small services (on free Dyno instances :stuck_out_tongue:) using this PaaS: it is well documented and it offers a lot of free tools. I assume I'll use it also next year.

## Best Youtube videos

- [Constraints Liberate, Liberties Constrain by Runar Bjarnason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqmsQeSzMdw)
- [Life Beyond the Illusion of Present by Jonas Boner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhz5jMXS8gE)
- [Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel by Dan Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)

## Best conferences

- Curry On, Rome
- BeeScala, Ljubljana
- NoSlidesConf, Bologna

## Best talks

- [To Macros and Beyond!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUM_WXac6hg), by Eugene Burmako  
@ Curry On, 19th July - Rome  
The academic discussion between Eugene Burmako and Matthias Felleisen has been a mind blowing experience!

- Funny Code, by Matteo Baglini  
@ NoSlidesConf, 3rd December - Bologna  
It was an interesting way to introduce functional programming concepts in Javascript (without a slide deck, indeed)!

- [Six years of Scala and counting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZdKPnDe9to), by Manuel Bernhardt  
@ BeeScala, 26th November, Ljubljana  
IMHO, this is the right approach to introduce Scala features in appealing way.

## Best quotes

- _"Clarity is the king."_ Bob Martin

## Best books

- **Thinking, Fast and Slow** - Daniel Kahneman
- **sbt in action** - Joshua Suereth and Matthew Farwell

## Best podcasts
